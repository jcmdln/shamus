`snagem` provides a simple way to track, retrieve, and manage content from sites
supported by [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) so it may be
enjoyed on your schedule.

This is currently a work-in-progress, with focus being directed toward iterating
over the [snagemd v1 API](./docs/openapi.yml). The goal is to ensure that the
API is intuitive and full-featured enough for our needs, as well as contexts a
user is likely to explore such as monitoring and maintenance actions.
